# Codex Agent Guide for Weights & Biases Docs

## What Codex Can Edit

- All markdown lives in `content/`
- `content/guides/` is manually authored and safe to edit
- `content/js/` and `content/ko/` contain the auto-generated translations. Do not edit.
- `content/ref/` is autogenerated reference documentation. Do not edit.
- `i18n/`, `layouts/`, `static/`, and `assets/` contain static-site assets and thayt sort of thing. Do not edit.

## Setup Instructions

- Run `hugo server` to preview changes
- Codex does not need to build production artifacts, just test preview locally

## Tasks Codex Can Run

- Rewrite markdown files to improve clarity and consistency
- Check formatting, shortcodes, and header levels
- Convert numbered lists to bullets where appropriate
- Flag broken Hugo shortcodes or syntax

## Validation Checklist

- Build with `hugo server` succeeds. 
- No broken shortcodes, links, or missing templates
- Avoid changing images or non-markdown content unless specifically requested
- Run `vale <filename.md>` to check a given Markdown file `<filename.md>` for style, clarity, passive voice, etc.. Review the Value Usage Guidelines for more info.
- Any suggestions flagged by Vale should be fixed inline. 
- In your output, explain to the human what edits you made and why. If an edit was made due to to a Vale styel violation, cite that violation in your output so the humans understand the change you made.

## Vale Usage Guidelines

-`.vale.ini` is the configuration file for Vale at the repo root â€” this config includes Google, Microsoft, and WriteGood packages
- Vale is installed using the portable Linux binary

## PR Guidelines

- Clearly explain in the PR description what file(s) were changed and why.
- Keep PRs scoped to a small number of files
- Include before and after diffs in PR body (optional but helpful)

## Tips for Codex

- Feel free to rewrite content for clarity, but avoid adding new content. In other words, you can edit existing content to improve readability, etc., but you should not add any new facts, unless specifically prompted.
- Use existing content in `content/guides/` as a style reference
- Codex should treat Hugo shortcodes as semantic and leave them unchanged unless formatting is clearly broken
